Let U be a universal set consisting of all the natural numbers until 20 and set A and B be a subset of U defined as A = {2, 5, 9, 15, 19} and B = {8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17}. Find A ∪ B.

Solution:

Given,

U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}

A = {2, 5, 9, 15, 19}

B = {8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17}

Answer: A ∪ B = {2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19}
